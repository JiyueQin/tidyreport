Description: A pipeline to conduct common statistical analyses, especially those done in the field of epidemiology and biostatistics and generate clean/formatted tables from the statistical output. The analyses include sample descriptive statistics, univariable testing (Wilcoxon rank sum, KW tests, Chisq/Fisher), regression analysis(linear, logistic, tobit, ordinal, LME, Normal GEE, Logistic GEE, Poisson GEE, Ordinal GEE, cox). The generated tables can be readily incorporated into Excel or Word for scientific paper writing.
